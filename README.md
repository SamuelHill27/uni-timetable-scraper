# Uni Timetable Scraper
### About
A small program designed to scrape the html page of the University of Nottingham's student term timetable.<br>
Every student has to view their timetable via this html page.<br>
Unfortunately, the timetable is ugly and not very easy to read.<br>
A friend of mine gave me the idea to create a program which allows for easy conversion to calendar apps like Google Calendar.<br> 
### How to use
Download the project and run the exe file.<br>
Complete the form on the GUI which loads
The form will require you to download the html page where the uni timetable is stored. **NOTE:** *download the timetable in list form as opposed to grid form.* <br>
Once the form has been sufficiently filled out, click the button and a csv file will be downloaded to your computer.<br>
You can then go to google calendar, settings, import and select the csv file that was downloaded.<br>
I would recommend that you create a new calendar and import to the newly created calendar so you can easily delete all the events after use.
